## *VI. Conclusion*
No nation, however powerful, or tech firm, regardless of its ambitions, is able to safeguard democracies against the full range of threats they face in 2020 and beyond. Only a multifaceted, polycentric approach that makes necessary changes up and down the stack will be up to the task. By working together, we might even be able to prove John Adams wrong by showing that—despite the challenges—democratic sustainability is indeed possible even in a hyper-connected future.<sup>305</sup>
