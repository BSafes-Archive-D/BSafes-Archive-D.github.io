## Conclusion

As counselors continue to move away from the disease model of pathology, sexual health topics such as the implications of sexual shame on wellness must be conceptualized from a sex-affirming, holistic, and biopsychosocial perspective. The present article outlined the various factors and experiences that may contribute to feelings of sexual shame. To support clients, counselors may employ specific strategies to enhance sexual empowerment, including narrative interventions, somatic exercises, expressive arts, and group interventions. When countertransference occurs as clients explore issues related to sex, sexuality, and intimacy, counselors are encouraged to seek supervision, process their experiences, and pursue their own counseling to obtain insight. Finally, counselors must reflect on their areas of competence and consider referring clients to specialists when appropriate.
