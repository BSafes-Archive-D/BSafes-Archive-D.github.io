## Referral to Specialists
Engaging in ethical sexuality counseling requires counselors to reflect on their scope of practice and areas of expertise to recognize when clients may require referral to other specialists. Whereas sexuality counseling addresses developmental influences on individual and relational sexual functioning (Southern & Cade, 2011), sex therapy reflects a more specialized form of treatment that utilizes known technical interventions to treat sexual dysfunction (Althof, 2010). Additionally, if a client’s sexual concern is related to a medical issue (e.g., weakened pelvic floor after childbirth, erection difficulties related to prostate cancer treatment), consultation and referral to a medical specialist may be advised. Thus, it is important that counselors build a referral network that includes sex therapists, gynecologists/urologists that specialize in sexual health, physical therapists that specialize in pelvic health, sex educators, and sexual product specialists and/or retailers.

Counselors must also acknowledge the treatment and ethical implications that may arise when referring clients to specialists. Specifically, counselors must carefully consider whether referral to a specialist is in the best interest of the client or due to their own feelings of personal discomfort (Binik & Meana, 2009). Counselors are additionally encouraged to engage in open, honest conversations with their clients when topics related to sex and sexuality venture into areas of which the counselor has limited competence or training (Corley & Schneider, 2002). Indeed, counselors are called to reflect on their professional scope of practice and refer clients to specialists, when applicable, to avoid doing harm (ACA; 2014).
