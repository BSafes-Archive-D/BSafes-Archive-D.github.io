## Deconstructing Sexual Shame in Counseling
Sexual shame is pervasive across cultures and communities, and throughout the lifespan. Thus, counselors must be prepared to encounter clients who are experiencing mental, emotional, and sexual health issues related to, and impacted by, clients’ feelings of shame. While sexual healthcare has historically been viewed as beyond professional counselors’ scope of practice, scholars in the mental health field have urged the integration of sexual wellness discussion throughout the counseling process, regardless of presenting issue or concern (Buehler, 2017; Southern & Cade, 2011). As evidenced by a professional identity rooted in wellness, human development, and social justice, professional counselors are uniquely positioned to address sexual health concerns within the context of clients’ holistic wellbeing.
