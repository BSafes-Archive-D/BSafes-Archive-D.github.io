## Breakdown and visibility
Following Desiriis’ argument, DDoS attacks can, thus, be interpreted as a struggle about technicity:

> surrounding milieu meets the human belief that defending such openness works in the service of a freer society.<sup>47</sup>

This perspective shares many concerns with debates in infrastructure studies that focus on the “enabling environments”<sup>48</sup> that are taken for granted during times of ‘normal’ operation. As John Durham Peters states, infrastructure is usually “full of inertia,” but at the same time remains “open to sabotage.” <sup>49</sup> Moments of crisis or breakdown are considered to be privileged vantage points for those studying infrastructure, because of their potential to reveal aspects that usually escape attention.

Many contributions in the field refer to the seminal list of characteristics of infrastructure developed by Star and Ruhleder, including the assertion that infrastructure “becomes visible upon breakdown.” <sup>50</sup> If infrastructure has a tendency to fade into the background, a key question is what kind of strategies can help in rendering it visible – what Bowker and Star have conceptualised as “infrastructural inversion.” <sup>51</sup> What is special about breakdown in this sense is that it not only allows researchers to observe socio-technical constellations in a state of uncertainty and negotiability, but also confronts ordinary users, i.e. those relying on the infrastructure in question, with the fragility of their enabling environments – “the server is down, the bridge washes out, there is a power blackout.” <sup>52</sup> While such moments of disruption might be experienced as irritating, they are also illuminating. As Jackson puts it, “Breakdown disturbs and sets in motion worlds of possibility that disappear under the stable or accomplished form of the artifact.” <sup>53</sup>

However, the strong association between breakdown and visibility that runs through infrastructure research<sup>54</sup> has also been subject to qualifications. In a recent

contribution to the debate, Seberger and Bowker question the premise that failure is an observable quality of an object, because this perspective disregards the role of human subjectivity in experiencing the visibility of infrastructure. <sup>55</sup> They highlight the fact that instances of “hyper-functionality” can be equally disturbing and are, thus, revealing from a subjective point of view. By broadening the range of human experiences that potentially contribute to the awareness of infrastructure, they seek to arrive at an understanding of breakdown that is not tied to “objectival visibility.” <sup>56</sup>

A different critique is developed in a seminal paper by Graham and Thrift. <sup>57</sup> Questioning the premise that breakdown appears in the form of extraordinary events, they seek to shift focus towards small and everyday instances of failures that they consider inherent to infrastructures. By assuming brokenness and decay, rather than smooth functionality, as the status quo, they seek to highlight the role of maintenance and repair that usually receives little attention. By focusing on the human labour that is necessary to keep infrastructures functional, this perspective also helps to grasp the profoundly sociotechnical nature of infrastructure, rather than seeing it as primarily technical arrangements. Jackson points out how this shift of focus, “draws our attention around the sociality of objects forward, into the ongoing forms of labor, power, and interest – neither dead nor congealed – that underpin the ongoing survival of things as objects in the world.” <sup>58</sup>

Both kinds of qualifications – the integration of subjective experience and the integration of maintenance and repair – thus seek to broaden the horizon of what can be considered as breakdown. They also tie in with a stronger orientation of the field towards process and practices reflected in the shift of terminology from infrastructures to “infrastructuring.” <sup>59</sup> However, scholarly contributions that more
