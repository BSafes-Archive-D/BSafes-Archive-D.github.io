## Common Issues Related to Sexual Shame
Counselors are called to explore the existence of sexual shame and its impact on the client’s presenting issues even when clients present into counseling for non-sexual reasons. The existing body of research has illuminated the negative effects of sexual shame on wellness (Feiring, Taska, & Chen, 2002; Feiring, Taska, & Lewis, 2002; Pulverman & Meston, 2020) and the intimate relationship between sexual health and wellness across the lifespan (Flynn et al., 2016). Sexual shame has a broad range of implications for clients’ overall health and may have negative associated outcomes for psychological, sexual, and relational functioning.

Internalized sexual shame may be a contributing factor to symptoms of depression and anxiety (Tangney & Dearing, 2002; Willie et al., 2016). Impairments related to sexual shame may also include difficulties with sexual desire and arousal, increased genito-pelvic pain, difficulty achieving orgasm, and may also lead to out-of-control sexual behaviors (Braun-Harvey & Vigorito, 2016; Pulverman & Meston, 2020). According to findings from Pulverman and colleagues (2018), approximately 65 to 85% of women who present with sexual dysfunction have experienced CSA. Additionally, individuals with high levels of sexual shame may experience challenges related to intimacy within their sexual and romantic relationships, which may contribute to asymmetrical desire, increased conflict, and resentment between partners (Sellers, 2017).

The insidious effects of shame on gender and sexual minority (GSM) persons are especially marked. Internalized homophobia and concealment have been linked to higher rates of shame (Show & Cheng, 2010; Sherry et al., 2010). Indeed, GSM persons who experience shame about their affectional and/or gender identities may struggle with embracing aspects of their authentic selves in ways that disconnect them from partners, peers, and GSM community members (Mereish & Poteat, 2015), and contribute to poor quality of relationships (Liang et al., 2002). Counselors are therefore encouraged to assess for the presence of sexual shame with all clients, regardless of presenting concern.
