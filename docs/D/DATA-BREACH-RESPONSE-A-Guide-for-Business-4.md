## For More Guidance From the FTC
This publication provides general guidance for an organization that has experienced a data breach. If you’d like more individualized guidance, you may contact the FTC at 1-877-ID-THEFT (877-438-4338). Please provide information regarding what has occurred, including the type of information taken, the number of people potentially affected, your contact information, and contact information for the law enforcement agent with whom you are working. The FTC can prepare its Consumer Response Center for calls from the people affected, help law enforcement with information from its national victim complaint database, and provide you with additional guidance as necessary. Because the FTC has a law enforcement role with respect to information privacy, you may seek guidance anonymously.

For additional information and resources, please visit business.ftc.gov.
