<sup>74</sup>Ibid., paras. 507–508. See, in particular, “…[i]mposing measures intended to prevent births within the 74 group…” include “…sexual mutilation, the practice of sterilization, forced birth control, separation of the sexes and prohibition of marriages. In patriarchal societies, where membership of a group is determined by the identity of the father, an example…is the case where, during rape, a woman of the said group is deliberately impregnated by a man of another group, with the intent to have her give birth to a child who will consequently not belong to its mother's group.”
