## Phases of DDoS: Technological developments
While shifts in values and organisational forms are key factors in describing the historical development of hacktivism more broadly, Desiriis suggests that

technological developments are central to identifying different phases in the development of DDoS specifically.<sup>31</sup>

Some of the first political DDoS attacks, such as the “netstrike” against Strano in 1995<sup>32</sup> and the “Deportation Class” action against Lufthansa in 2001, <sup>33</sup> relied on users who manually and repeatedly sent requests to the targeted server by reloading a website. As Sauter shows, this first phase was quickly superseded by methods where the sending of requests was automatically performed by software such as the Floodnet software used in the Zapatista campaigns.<sup>34</sup> Many DDoS actions performed by Anonymous involved a software called the Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC) that, once installed on a user’s computer, could be instructed to send large amounts of requests to a target server. <sup>35</sup>

The third phase in Desiriis’ periodisation of the technological development of DDoS is characterised by the increasing involvement of botnets. The most prominent example for this phase is a malware called Mirai, which succeeded in infecting huge numbers of low-end Internet of Things devices, such as security cameras, video recorders and routers, in 2016.<sup>36</sup> This botnet resulted in some of the largest DDoS attacks to date, including an attack on DynDNS that caused major websites including Twitter,* The New York Times*, Reddit and Netflix to become inaccessible for several hours at a time. Within the course of a few months, similar attacks based on Mirai botnets were launched against telecommunication companies and media organisations, as well as blogs of individual journalists.<sup>37</sup>

Functionally, there are similarities between sending requests in an automated way via software like the LOIC and a botnet like the one assembled by Mirai. In each case, a network of computing devices is made to adhere to instructions that are issued from a specific location (a command and control server in the case of botnets, an IRC chat channel controlled by Anonymous in the case of LOIC), which makes it possible

to synchronise these devices’ resources in order to target a server and overwhelm its capacities. However, while the LOIC, to varying degrees, relied on the *voluntary* contribution of bandwidth and computing power of those using the software, botnets consist of devices that are used for these purposes *without* the consent of their owners.
