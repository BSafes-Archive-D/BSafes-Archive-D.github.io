### Abstract
India, a mosaic of ethnic, religious, linguistic, and social factions, exhibits unity in diversity. As a result, Indian women come from diverse cultures, terrains, religions, and classes. They perform diverse social roles and have varied lived experiences, which augment assorted issues. Consequently, a review of the literature on Indian feminism highlights its complicacy. Mukhopadhyay (2016) explains that Indian feminism, which was primarily initiated by men (Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Jyotirao Phule, and others) mainly focussed on the abolition of evil practices like *Sati, Purdah*, polygamy, child marriage, illiteracy, and the rest. The concept of “Intersectionality” and intersectional oppression was neither known nor understood hence not represented by Indian feminists. In such a situation, adhering to the maxim ‘Personal is Political,’ it became the duty of the women, whose gender intersects with caste to represent their unique lived experiences. This paper attempts to gain insight into the world of Dalit women through the exploration of their select writings. P. Sivakami’s *The Grip of Change*, Bama’s Sangati, and Meena Kandaswami’s poetry anthology *Touch* are used as literary study tools. The study demonstrates how the narratives of Dalit women provide a unique concept of “Indian intersectionality,” where their social and political identities combine to create different modes of discrimination and disadvantage making them vulnerable to violence. The study may help us to understand approaches to the prevention of violence against Dalit women.

*Keywords*: Caste, gender, intersectionality, vulnerability, violence, silence, impunity, Dalit women, India, feminism
