## Introduction
In financial inclusion digital technologies are playing a vital role, it is confirmed by the meteoric rise of mobile money in recent years especially across emerging markets. So far, we are behind a significant gap between usage and access. Launching a new financial service is not meant, it will use widely by the all. Digital financial literacy (DFL) is the application of financial literacy and digital literacy to enable the use of digital financial services – It is increasingly being seen as the solution for addressing and use of Digital Financial Services (DFS). Though, what we mean by DFL is not all the times understood as commonly. To make matters even more complicated, there are a number of associated market barriers that must be addressed concurrently or in advance of any DFL activities in order for them to succeed. Libraries and information centers are paternalistic, considers as service-oriented and kind of a not-for-profit (NFP) organization. Financial management in such service oriented and nonprofit organizations is more composite and stimulating than in profit-based organizations. Money administration in service-oriented and nonprofit organization comprises systematic planning, judicious spending of funds, getting funds and meticulous accounting. There are certain problems in financial management of service-based and nonprofit organizations. Some of issues are discussed below with important characteristics of such organizations together. The problem becomes more apparent if such organizations' budgets are not prepared as part of the parent body's planning and if they are more disturbed with accounting than planning. The labor-intensive nature of service-oriented and nonprofit organizations, as opposed to the machine and technology-intensive nature of profit-making organizations, the lack of inventory (because they will have no inventory of services), the dominance of professionals, the difficulty of inspecting and measuring the quality of service prior to delivery (i.e., before rendering the service), and so on are all important characteristics. Service oriented and charitable organizations are notorious for their lack of profit measures.
