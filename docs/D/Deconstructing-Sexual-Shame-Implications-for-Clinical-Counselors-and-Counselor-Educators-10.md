## Attending to Countertransference

Counselors may face countertransference during sexuality counseling as the result of their own sexual experiences or internalized feelings of sexual shame. Clients who explore intimate topics related to sexual, affectional, and gender identities, sexual activities, and experiences of sexual trauma may elicit feelings of countertransference in counselors. Counselors who experience countertransference in response to clients are encouraged to pursue supervision, process their feelings with colleagues, or engage in their own counseling to obtain valuable insight as to the reasons for their reactions (Fisher, 2004; Rodgers, 2011). Experiencing countertransference, including sexual feelings towards clients, may be normalized and in and of themselves, do not constitute sexual misconduct (Fisher, 2004).
